            My name is Georgy, I'm from Kemerovo, Russia.
          I graduated Bachelor of Computer Science from Tomsk State University in 2011, then graduated with Master of
          Computer Science in Geodesics and Cartography from Tomsk State University (Tomsk, Russia) in 2013.
          In 2021 I have defended my thesis "Probabilistic modeling of the dynamics of asteroids and meteoroids
            moving in conditions of superposition of various types" and was awarded with the degree of Candidate of
            Physical and Mathematical Sciences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a motivated professional with strong analytical skills. I am skilled in identifying and documenting
            quality user business requirements for new product implementations and major enhancements. Looking for a
            role where I can contribute to an inspired team of people, solve problems and improve the end users
            experience of using a product.
          </p>

            My native language is Russian, but also I speak English, using it in everyday work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have done candidate of science in physics and mathematics in 2021. During the course of my at the
            postgraduate program I had an opportunity to work on near-Earth asteroid orbital dynamics, resonant
            mechanisms that their overlapping results in chaotization of the motion of asteroids, near-Earth object
            population modeling, characterization of objects of interest for various groups of researchers, and the
            asteroid impact hazard threat and possible mitigation techniques. This internship inculcated many pragmatic
            accomplishments in me. As a result, I am fairly competent in following skills:

          <p>
            I am working as Deputy Head of Internet Technologies Department in one of the leading the construction
            company LSR Group. Since then, every coming year has proven to be professionally more rewarding than its
            precedent. As a result, I am quite competent in following IT-skills:

            experience researching, preparing the formation of organizational models: description of business processes,
            roles, authorizations and identifying new implementation needs in product by the company and upgrade the
            current ones, as well as a strong background in the celestial mechanics, with a special interest in the
            field of chaotization of the motion of asteroids. I am quite familiar with qualitative and quantitative data
            collection techniques and would greatly enjoy assisting your company in incorporating this knowledge into
            specific research initiatives as appropriate. Therefore, I see a very good fit between your needs and my

          <p>I think of technologies and programming like as art. I like beuty architecture decisions and feel

          <p><b>Description:</b> The aim of this work was to build the probabilistic orbital evolution of asteroids moving under conditions of superimposed perturbations of various types, to study the resonant interactions of asteroids with planets and the manifestation of chaos in the motion of objects, including asteroids (196256) 2003 EH1 and 3200 Phaethon.
Firstly, there was investigate numerically the dynamical evolution of simulated meteoroid stream of the Quadrantids ejected from the parent body of the asteroid (196256) 2003 EH1. The main goal of this work is to identify mean motion and secular resonances and to study the mutual influence of resonance relations and close encounters with the major planets. 
Secondly, there was considered the dynamics of asteroid 3200 Phaethon, reveal its encounters with planets, mean motion and secular resonances, and estimate the predictability time and the causes of chaoticity.</p>
