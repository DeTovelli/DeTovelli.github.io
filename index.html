            My name is Georgy, I'm from Kemerovo, Russia.
            I graduated Bachelor of Computer Science from Tomsk State University in 2011, then graduated with Master of
            Computer Science in Geodesics and Cartography from Tomsk State University (Tomsk, Russia) in 2013.
            In 2021 I have defended my thesis "Probabilistic modeling of the dynamics of asteroids and meteoroids
            moving in conditions of superposition of various types" and was awarded with the degree of Candidate of
            Physical and Mathematical Sciences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a motivated professional with strong analytical skills. I am skilled in identifying and documenting
            quality user business requirements for new product implementations and major enhancements. Looking for a
            role where I can contribute to an inspired team of people, solve problems and improve the end users
            experience of using a product.
          </p>
          <p>
            My native language is Russian, but also I speak English, using it in everyday work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have done candidate of science in physics and mathematics in 2021. During the course of my at the
            postgraduate program I had an opportunity to work on near-Earth asteroid orbital dynamics, resonant
            mechanisms that their overlapping results in chaotization of the motion of asteroids, near-Earth object
            population modeling, characterization of objects of interest for various groups of researchers, and the
            asteroid impact hazard threat and possible mitigation techniques. This internship inculcated many pragmatic
            accomplishments in me. As a result, I am fairly competent in following skills:

            <li>Teamwork</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I am working as Deputy Head of Internet Technologies Department in one of the leading the construction
            company LSR Group. Since then, every coming year has proven to be professionally more rewarding than its
            precedent. As a result, I am quite competent in following IT-skills:
          </p>
          <ul class="info-section__list">

            I am also very interested in the theoretical challenges and problems in the IT sphere. I have extensive
            experience researching, preparing the formation of organizational models: description of business processes,
            roles, authorizations and identifying new implementation needs in product by the company and upgrade the
            current ones, as well as a strong background in the celestial mechanics, with a special interest in the
            field of chaotization of the motion of asteroids. I am quite familiar with qualitative and quantitative data
            collection techniques and would greatly enjoy assisting your company in incorporating this knowledge into
            specific research initiatives as appropriate. Therefore, I see a very good fit between your needs and my
            interests and abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am able to work alone or as a part of a team, and I like working with people.

          </p>
          <p>
            During all these professional phases, I have a history of proven results and profound findings. I'm
            confident in my abilities to earn similar groundbreaking results while being part of your team. If you need

          <p>I think of technologies and programming like as art. I like beuty architecture decisions and feel

          <p>I think every tool must have a usecase and vise versa. So when I choose some library I think about what

            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
              The paper presents numerical models of mean-motion resonances detected in the Quadrantid meteoroid stream
              consisting of particles of mass 0.003 to 0.03 g, which helps to prove the presence of the following
              mean-motion resonances: the 1:9 resonance with Venus, 1:5 resonance with Earth, 1:3 and 3:8 resonances
              with Mars, and 2:1,7:3, 9:4 resonances with Jupiter. Resonance particles create dust trails far from the
              Earth orbit. Indeed, there is no observational support for resonant effects in the observed Quadrantid
              meteoroid stream.

              We investigate numerically the dynamical evolution of simulated meteoroid stream of the Quadrantids
              ejected from the parent body of the asteroid (196256) 2003 EH1. The main goal of this work is to identify
              mean motion and secular resonances and to study the mutual influence of resonance relations and close
              encounters with the major planets. Since the dynamics of this asteroid is predictable only on short time
              intervals, and not only close and/or multiple close encounters with major planets, but also the presence
              of at least one unstable resonance can lead to chaotic motion of test particles, we studied their resonant
              dynamics. The dynamical evolution of the test particles expects possible scenario for resonant motion. We
              conjecture that the reasons of chaos are the overlap of stable secular resonances and unstable mean
              motions resonances and close and/or multiple close encounters with the major planets. The estimate of the
              stability of orbits in which the particles in simulations moved was carried out by analyzing the behavior
              of the parameter MEGNO (Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits). The larger part of the
              identified resonances is stable. We found a peculiar behavior for this stream. Here, we show that the
              orbits of some ejected particles are strongly affected by the Lidov-Kozai mechanism that protects them
              from close encounters with Jupiter. Lack of close encounters with Jupiter leads to a rather smooth growth
              in the parameter MEGNO and the behavior imply the stable motion of simulation particles of the Quadrantids
              meteoroid stream.

              This paper is devoted to investigation of the influence of various perturbing factors on accuracy of
              probabilistic model of asteroid 2011 MD motion. The degree of influence of each perturbing acceleration
              has been estimated using indicator of the force model. This indicator has been determined on the basis of
              the algorithm in which the errors of force models are tightly connected with sizes of confidence regions
              and displacements of the least-square estimations defined for different models of motion of asteroids. For
              object 2011 MD the influence of the Sun oblateness and relativistic effects caused by the Sun has been of
              less importance then the influence of gravitational perturbations from the Moon and the Earth oblateness.
              The investigation probabilistic orbital evolution on the basis of different force models has shown that
              the neglect of perturbing accelerations whose indicator of the force model is greater than the threshold
              value can lead to divergence of orbits.

              This paper is devoted to the dynamics of asteroid (196256) 2003 EH1 that belongs to the Amor group. It is
              known that the asteroid 2003 EH1 is associated with one of the main annual meteor showers the Quadrantids.
              In this work we analyze the influence of various perturbing factors on the asteroid motion. The
              perturbations estimation was done by five different methods based on the nominal orbit evolution and the
              size of the initial confidence region. The most significant influences on the dynamical evolution of 2003
              EH1 are gravitational forces from the Sun, major planets and the Moon, and the relativistic effects (RE)
              of the Sun. Of less importance are the Earth, the Sun and Jupiter oblateness; gravitational perturbations
              from Pallas, Ceres, Vesta and Pluto; and the RE of planets, the Moon, and Pluto. The researches of
              chaoticity and evolution of asteroid 2003 EH1 were examined by integrating its motion equations along with
              500 clones. The time interval (from 1000 to 4000 years) has been determined by integration precision
              estimation. We calculated the mean exponential growth factor of nearby orbits (MEGNO) and found that MEGNO
              less than two only in the interval from 1700 to 2300. After 2300 year the MEGNO parameter increases that
              indicates motion instability. It shows that the orbit may be considered as regular on the time interval of
              300 years from now, and as chaotic outside this interval. The reason, as we suppose, is frequent close
              approaches of the asteroid with Jupiter and the overlap of apsidal nodal resonances.
